"""Mean-variance portfolio optimization, following Markowitz (1952).

Throughout, `w` is a vector of portfolio weights that sums to one, `mu` is the
vector of expected returns, and `Sigma` is the covariance matrix of returns.
Weights may be negative (short positions are allowed).

The notebook `01_markowitz.ipynb.py` derives everything you need. Your job in
HW 0 is to move that logic out of the notebook and into the two functions
marked TODO below, so that the tests in `test_port_opt.py` pass.
